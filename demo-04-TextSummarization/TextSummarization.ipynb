Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:09 EST, 9 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:27 EST, 9 December 2013 . Sending a Christmas card should be a chance to wish season's greetings and make vague promises to catch up in the New Year. But for political leaders it is increasingly a carefully choreographed, intensely observed photo opportunity to present themselves as a relaxed man of the people. Labour leader Ed Miliband today released his smart-casual festive offering, featuring his wife and sons in a pose which would not look out of place in a mail order catalogue. Labour leader Ed Miliband and his wife Justine take their children Daniel (left) and Sam (right) for a walk along Brighton beach, in a photograph chosen for his official Christmas card . The Miliband family portrait shows Mr Miliband and wife Justine with their sons Daniel and Samuel. It was taken during a walk along Brighton beach at the start of the Labour Party conference earlier this year as the family headed out to a play park before the heavy political agenda got under way. In smart trousers and a grey pullover, Mr Miliband appears to be straining to look relaxed. When the pictures were taken in September it was noted that they were markedly different to Gordon Brown\\u2019s refusal to be photographed with his own young children. But Labour strategists made clear that they wanted to give Mrs Miliband a more high profile role in a bid to give her husband a popularity boost. The release of the Labour leader's card comes after Number 10 revealed David Cameron\\u2019s three-year-old daughter Florence has been given a starring role in the Prime Minister\\u2019s official Christmas card - for the second time. Greeting: Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha photographed with daughter Florence at 10 Downing Street for their 2013 Christmas card . The striking black and white portrait features Mr Cameron and wife Samantha hugging their daughter inside Number 10 in October. The card will be sent around the globe to world leaders and dignitaries, as well as to senior figures in the UK. Captured . by award-winning photographer Tom Stoddart, the picture shows the . Camerons\\u2019 youngest child gripping her father\\u2019s neck while she snuggles . against her mother. UKIP leader Nigel Farage . It . is striking that the three-year-old features so prominently because . David Cameron has closely guarded his children\\u2019s privacy since moving to . Number 10 and usually requests that all photographs of them are . pixelated. Mr Cameron has opted for a photograph of . himself and wife Samantha each year since taking power in 2010, when . they chose the photograph of the couple holding baby Florence on the . steps of Number 10. The outspoken MEP Godfrey Bloom does not take himself so seriously. After . a year in which he has grabbed the headlines for outspoken comments . about aid to \\u2018Bongo Bongo Land\\u2019 and women being \\u2018sluts\\u2019 for not doing . the cleaning properly, the 64-year-old and his wife have posed for a . self-mocking Christmas card. Godfrey Bloom holds bongos in their Christmas card and wife Katie does her best 'slut' impression . The MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, . who quit the UK Independence Party in September to sit as an . independent, clutches bongos given to him by a music shop while his wife . Katie is dressed as a \\u2018slut\\u2019. The . photo, taken in the kitchen of the couple\\u2019s house in a village near . Goole, East Yorkshire, will be on cards posted to friends and family. But his old boss, UKIP leader Nigel Farage, takes a very different view about the trend for political leaders to feature in their own cards. 'Rest assured, any cards sent from family Farage will be suitably festive rather than have my face on it,' he said. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond revealed his official Christmas card last week, an imposing artwork of the fourth wise man who . turned up too late to see Jesus. He opted for the bleak, sinewy painting of Artaban by Scottish artist Peter Howson. Festive? This painting of the fourth wise man Artaban by Peter Howson will grace the front of the First Minister Alex Salmond's 2013 charity Christmas card . The . artwork will be sold to raise money for charity, but some questioned . whether its choice for a Christmas card was not very festive. Since 2007 Mr Salmond . has raised \\u00a3148,000 for charities in Scotland through sales of the . original artwork and limited edition prints of his official card. Today . he unveiled the Howson painting, which will be sold at auction in the . New Year with the proceeds shared between the Children's Hospice . Association Scotland (Chas), CLIC Sargent, Scottish Catholic . International Aid Fund (Sciaf) and Combat Stress, the charity chosen by . the artist. He insisted the image of Artaban is a \\u2018hugely appropriate\\u2019 work for his card. Mr Salmond said: \\u2018The legend of . Artaban, or the fourth wise man, is based on a novel by Henry van Dyke. It tells the tale of a Persian scholar who, delayed by helping the . vulnerable, follows the star to Bethlehem but arrives just too late to . herald the birth of the Christ child. \\u2018Thirty years on in Jerusalem, at Passover, Artaban is still searching. \\u2018Now . an old man, he parts with the last of his three gifts to Jesus, a . sapphire, a ruby and a pearl, to save a young girl from slavery. However, in a dying vision, Artaban is comforted that his devotion to . the distressed has secured him entrance to the kingdom of heaven. \\u2018The story reminds us that hope, faith and self-sacrifice are at the centre of the order of things.\",\n          \"Attacked: Levi Rosenblat, 22, is in hospital after he was stabbed in the temple early on Tuesday . A knife-wielding man has been shot dead by police after he burst into a Brooklyn synagogue and stabbed an Israeli student in the head while shouting: 'Kill the Jews!' Calvin Peters, 51,\\u00a0stormed into the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic world headquarters in Crown Heights at about 1.40am on Tuesday and attacked Levi Rosenblat, who was studying inside the synagogue. Rosenblat, who is in stable condition in hospital after being stabbed in the temple, only arrived in the U.S. two weeks ago, the New York Daily News reported. Witnesses heard the man saying 'Kill the Jews' repeatedly and several other people immediately intervened,\\u00a0said Chaim Landa, a spokeswoman for Chabad-Lubavitch. A witness flagged down a patrol officer, who confronted the stabber and told him to put the knife down. He initially put it down, but picked it up again, police said. More officers responded and repeatedly ordered the man to drop the knife. He refused and, with the knife in his hand, charged at one of the officers, who fired once, striking the man in the torso, police said. Police said no other officers discharged their weapons. Footage of the incident shared by 0404 shows the man moving towards police with the knife as an officer shouts: 'Drop the f***ing knife'. As the person recording the video seeks shelter behind a book case, a single shot rings out. Scroll down for videos . Stand off: The stabber, identified as Calvin Peters, can be seen after police confront him for stabbing a 22-year-old student in a Brooklyn synagogue on Tuesday morning. He was later shot by an officer . Shot: Police say he refused to drop his knife and then ran at an officer, who shot him once in the torso. A grab from video from 0404 shows the man being handcuffed after he was gunned dow . The man was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. Police said he was from New York City and had a criminal history.\\u00a0CNN reported that he was believed to be homeless. A nine-inch knife, with a four-inch blade, was recovered at the scene, police said. A witness told the Daily News, that he ran over to Rosenblat, who is from Beitar Illit in Gush Etzion, after he was stabbed. 'I went over to the floor,' he said. 'I saw the teenager on the floor, his hair was blood. He was saying \\\"save me\\\".' Another witness said they saw the stabber enter the synagogue an hour earlier and ask for a book before returning with a knife and carried out his attack. Weapon: This blood-covered knife was recovered at the scene following the early-morning attack . Scene: The attack unfolded at the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic world headquarters in Crown Heights . In shock: Members of the Lubavitch community and police officers stand outside Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic headquarters on Tuesday, just hours after the knife-wielding man was shot dead . 'We commend the heroic efforts of the individuals who were present and took immediate action. If not for their intervention the outcome could have been, God forbid far worse,' said Landa. 'While we are very pained by everything that has unfolded, we are very grateful to the police for their quick response and are working closely with the authorities in their ongoing investigation,' she added. Police said the investigation is continuing.\",\n          \"By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . Be afraid, be very afraid. A spooky mansion that looks like the Addams Family house is on sale in Sydney's trendy suburb of Paddington. It is the first time the 19th century home has gone on sale since the 1920s. Originally built as a farmhouse, the mansion boats five bedrooms, a large kitchen, two bathrooms and 3.3m high ceilings, but needs extensive work. Nicknamed the 'Addams Family' the five bedroom house at 284 Moore Park Rd, Paddington needs plenty of TLC . Rich in history, it was built during the 1800s as a farmhouse before being converted into a gentleman\\u2019s residence in 1873 . Perfect for sports loving renovators looking for a a challenge, the mansion sits opposite the Sydney Cricket Ground, Allianz Stadium and the Entertainment Quarter and is one of the biggest blocks on the street. Set on nearly 400sq m of land the Queen Anne style home features a classic entry . hall; five bedrooms; grand reception rooms; a large dine-in kitchen; . a sun room; a family room with enclosed verandah and two bathrooms. The three story home is named the 'Verulum' which is the ancient name for London, and has been lived in for the past ninety years by one of the daughters of the original owner. Although of mid Victorian origins, the building's fa\\u00e7ade reflects a Queen Anne style . The current owner has lived in the mansion for 90 years . Did we mention the stables? This property also has stables that can be converted into a granny flat or a large triple lock-up garage; a rarity on the streets of Paddington. The Verulum was built as a farmhouse before being converted into a residential property in 1873. It featured fine fittings and dimensions, many which still remain today. The home is expected to go for more than $2 million when it goes to auction on September 11. During the 1880s other buildings were being erected in Paddington near the tram line and the Victoria Barracks. The house has a cellar that during World War II became the family's air raid shelter and a safe house .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Miliband family photograph taken during Labour party conference .\\nParty leader walking with wife Justine and sons Samuel and Daniel .\\nDavid Cameron opts for snap with wife Samantha and daughter Florence .\\nEx-UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom poses with bongo drums and wife as a 'slut'\",\n          \"Calvin Peters, 51, stormed into the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic world HQ in Crown Heights at 1.40am on Tuesday and stabbed Levi Rosenblat .\\nThe student, who arrived in Brooklyn two weeks ago, is in stable condition .\\nPeters stabbed him in the temple and when police arrived, he put the knife down before grabbing it again and running at an officer .\\nHe was shot once and later died in hospital .\\nParts of the harrowing incident were caught on video by witnesses .\",\n          \"Unique mansion listed for the first time since 1924, is up for sale in Sydney .\\nOne of the biggest blocks on the street, it sits opposite the Sydney Cricket Ground .\\nThe 18th century building was originally a farmhouse and sits on a 400sq metre block .\\nThe three-level home has five bedrooms and 3.3m high ceilings .\\nDaughter of one of the original owners has lived in it for the past 90 years .\\nIs expected to fetch over $2 million when it goes to auction September 11 .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Dataset\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"CNN/Daily Mail\",\n          \"Multi-News\",\n          \"XSum\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

and in w magazine, and worked with famed photographer steven meisel on a film. for five seasons rupaul drag race has demystified drag queens and redefined a standard of beauty. rupaul drag race executive producer tom campbell told cnn, the first face of mac viva glam was rupaul, (who) was a pioneer for drag performers. now it carmen carrera chance to break the 'beauty barrier' for trans people. while the lgbt community has made some strides around the nation, carrera said she still comes across many people who simply don't understand the transgender community. for a long time trans people have always been a joke. our reputation has always been the bottom of the barrel and it not fair, she said. carrera confessed that her transition to a woman was both a physical and emotional uphill battle. i run into a lot of ignorance and stupidity, carrera said. it gets really frustrating, but you have to take yourself out of it and realize what happening in the bigger picture. a lot of people are still uncomfortable with this idea, i don't know why. i think most of the country and the world haven't gotten to know trans people. if you don't know me, get to know me. i'm open, honest and genuine. it difficult for people (who) don't know trans men and women to wrap their head around the whole thing, campbell said. that why it so important that more trans people have a chance to tell their stories and, as is the case with carmen, to give a face ... to the trans movement. model and designer isis king was the first trans woman to compete on america next top model, and said that while the petitioners' hearts might be in the right place, the petition itself might not be the best approach. i don't want any special treatment because i'm trans unless there a particular role made for it. i want my legacy to be that i was hard-working and good at what i did, king said, should victoria secret have a trans model? sure, why not. but should they be pressured into hiring one? no, i don't think it fair. king isn't offended that the lingerie company doesn't have a trans model. she knows firsthand how difficult it is for any woman to land a spot in the elite group of victoria secret models. if trans people are going to make any strides in society it shouldn't be forced, but if anyone can make it as a victoria secret model it carmen. she beautiful and just did a runway show with marco marco and was amazing, king said. while carrera didn't join the angels for the victoria secret runway show in new york on november 13, she said she has the love and support from those that matter most: her family, friends and fans. i have an education, stepdaughter and go to pta meetings. i live my life as a woman does in this country, carrera said, that what people need to know. if carrera ever does become an angel, campbell said she would bring rupaul trademark charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent to victoria secret, and thinks she on the right path. but, if he had to give any advice he would say, to quote rupaul: i have one thing to say. you better work! do you think victoria secret should hire carmen carrera?

              "\"Ashton Kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding under-fire taxi-hiring app Uber and defended controversial comments made by an executive who\\xa0suggested spending $1 million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize the company. Kutcher, an investor in the app, took to Twitter on Wednesday to show his support for beleaguered VP Emil Michael and described Sarah Lacy, a female journalist who has been highly critical of the company, as 'shady'. 'What is so wrong about digging up dirt on shady journalist?' tweeted the celebrity tech entrepreneur who has invested in tech firms including Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb and Spotify through his\\xa0venture capital firm A-Grade. Under-fire: Ashton Kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding taxi-hiring app Uber and defended Senior VP Emil Michael who suggested spending $1 million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize the company . Outburst: Kutcher, an investor in the app, took to Twitter on Wednesday to attack Sarah Lacy, the journalist who has criticized the company . 'So as long as journalist are interested and willing to print half truths as facts... Yes we should question the source' he continued in a series of tweets before he sought to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not Uber. 'This should be fun... Here comes the part where journalist explain why they should be exempt from ridicule and judgement and probing...' he continued. The actor's attempt to defend Uber quickly provoked a negative reaction from many Twitter users who accused him of only getting involved because he was an investor in the company and of unfairly describing Lacy as shady for reporting facts about the service. 'A journalist harassed by a company you invested in. Nice' tweeted @tiedtiger. 'What makes her shady?' wrote @KeenPOV. 'Pointing out how some Uber drivers are sexual assailants?' Not long after Kutcher decided it might be best just to apologize. 'U r all right and I'm on the wrong side of this ultimately. I just wish journalists were held to the same standards as public figures,' he tweeted. Target: Kutcher was speaking with specific reference to Sarah Lacy (left), editor of PandoDaily, who recently wrote about deleting her Uber app (right) after the firm teamed up with an apparent escort service in France . Kutcher's attempt to defend Uber provoked a negative reaction from many Twitter users who accused him of only getting involved because he was an investor in the company . In 2011, Kutcher was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after tweeting that the sacking of Joe Paterno as head coach of Penn State showed 'no class' and was an 'insult' to his legacy. Many people labelled Kutcher an idiot for his view and after a barrage of complaints he deleted his tweet and recanted his stance. 'This is an insane story, I just heard paterno was fired, getting the rest of the story now... Wow,' he wrote. He added: 'Heard Joe was fired, fully recant previous tweet! Didn't have full story. #admitwhenYoumakemistakes' Kutcher's Uber comment come a day after Emil Michael was forced to make a grovelling apology over his controversial comments. The senior vice president was speaking at a private dinner in Manhattan on Friday, when he said that he had dreamed up an eight-man team who would find out about writers' personal lives and families so that Uber could discredit them. The sinister scheme - which was targeted at a Silicon Valley editor who has savaged the company for its alleged 'sexism and misogyny' - drew an outraged backlash when it became public. Tweets: Kutcher made a series of tweets on Wednesday in which was critical of journalist Sarah Lacy  before seeking to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not Uber . A chorus of disapproval aimed at Michael prompted a humiliating public apology to Sarah Lacy, the editor of PandoDaily, in which he disowned the idea entirely. Michael posted an apology to Lacy's Twitter account, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly. My comments were wrong and I deeply regret them. 'Neither me [sic] nor my company would ever engage in such activities. Again, I apologize.' The remarks will do little to improve Uber's fragile relationship with the media following the portrayal of its management team as insensitive and aggressive toward customer complaints. And, indeed, the apology did not stop Lacy from writing a scathing opinion piece\\xa0on PandoDaily, in which she said the plan was 'like a five-year-old pretending to be Frank Underwood' - a reference to Kevin Spacey's scheming politician character in Netflix series House of Cards. According to Lacy, Michael also called her cell phone and ask to speak in private, but hung up after she refused to have an off-the-record conversation. The dinner party in question was hosted by Ian Osborne, ex-adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron and consultant for Uber . Michael's plan came up when he was asked about the firm's negative press coverage. Venue: During the dinner party at Manhattan's Waverly Inn (pictured), Michael was reportedly asked about the firm's depictions in the press and responded that Uber should consider hiring researchers to snoop on writers . In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15 billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, according to BuzzFeed. The eight-strong hit team would investigate 'your personal lives, your families' with a view to discrediting journalists behind\\xa0unfavorable\\xa0reports on the taxi service, he said. Michael was especially focused on Lacy, who also recently accused Uber of 'sexism and misogyny' on her Silicon Valley website, writing: 'The company simply doesn’t respect us or prioritize our safety.' He reportedly expressed anger over her claims that, responding that women are far more likely to suffer assault at the hands of normal taxi drivers than Uber drivers. He said Lacy should be held 'personally responsible' for any women who copy her and delete the taxi app, and are then sexually assaulted, it is reported . Apology: Michael, who used to work at Klout and also sits on a board advising the Department of Defense, later took to Twitter to apologize for his comments to Lacy herself, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly' Contradicting his remarks: He added: 'Neither me nor my company would ever engage in such activities' And in reference to a specific claim about Lacy's personal life, he said Uber's dirt-diggers could work covertly to expose and discredit her to others, adding: 'Nobody would know it was us.' After being confronted about his comments, Michael, who has been at Uber for more than a year and was previously described as a 'top deal guy' by founder Travis Kalanick, later apologized. In a statement to BuzzFeed on Monday evening, he said he believed he was speaking off the record and that\\xa0his remarks did not reflect his or Uber's views. 'The remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what I feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company I am proud to work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company’s views or approach,' he said. 'They were wrong no matter the circumstance and I regret them.' At no point during the dinner did Michael suggest the firm has already hired opposition researchers. An Uber spokesman confirmed that the company does not carry out such research and has never considered doing it because it would be a 'clear violation of our privacy and data access policies'. The event at Waverly Inn on Friday evening was attended by a number of high-profile figures, including\\xa0actor Ed Norton\\xa0and publisher Arianna Huffington.

              "\"ashton kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding under-fire taxi-hiring app uber and defended controversial comments made by an executive who suggested spending $1 million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize the company. kutcher, an investor in the app, took to twitter on wednesday to show his support for beleaguered vp emil michael and described sarah lacy, a female journalist who has been highly critical of the company, as hady'. 'what is so wrong about digging up dirt on shady journalist?' tweeted the celebrity tech entrepreneur who has invested in tech firms including skype, foursquare, airbnb and spotify through his venture capital firm a-grade. under-fire: ashton kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding taxi-hiring app uber and defended senior vp emil michael who suggested spending $1 million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize the company . outburst: kutcher, an investor in the app, took to twitter on wednesday to attack sarah lacy, the journalist who has criticized the company . o as long as journalist are interested and willing to print half truths as facts... yes we should question the source' he continued in a series of tweets before he sought to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not uber. 'this should be fun... here comes the part where journalist explain why they should be exempt from ridicule and judgement and probing...' he continued. the actor attempt to defend uber quickly provoked a negative reaction from many twitter users who accused him of only getting involved because he was an investor in the company and of unfairly describing lacy as shady for reporting facts about the service. 'a journalist harassed by a company you invested in. nice' tweeted tiedtiger. 'what makes her shady?' wrote keenpov. 'pointing out how some uber drivers are sexual assailants?' not long after kutcher decided it might be best just to apologize. 'u r all right and i'm on the wrong side of this ultimately. i just wish journalists were held to the same standards as public figures,' he tweeted. target: kutcher was speaking with specific reference to sarah lacy (left), editor of pandodaily, who recently wrote about deleting her uber app (right) after the firm teamed up with an apparent escort service in france . kutcher attempt to defend uber provoked a negative reaction from many twitter users who accused him of only getting involved because he was an investor in the company . in 2011, kutcher was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after tweeting that the sacking of joe paterno as head coach of penn state showed 'no class' and was an 'insult' to his legacy. many people labelled kutcher an idiot for his view and after a barrage of complaints he deleted his tweet and recanted his stance. 'this is an insane story, i just heard paterno was fired, getting the rest of the story now... wow,' he wrote. he added: 'heard joe was fired, fully recant previous tweet! didn't have full story. #admitwhenyoumakemistakes' kutcher uber comment come a day after emil michael was forced to make a grovelling apology over his controversial comments. the senior vice president was speaking at a private dinner in manhattan on friday, when he said that he had dreamed up an eight-man team who would find out about writers' personal lives and families so that uber could discredit them. the sinister scheme - which was targeted at a silicon valley editor who has savaged the company for its alleged exism and misogyny' - drew an outraged backlash when it became public. tweets: kutcher made a series of tweets on wednesday in which was critical of journalist sarah lacy before seeking to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not uber . a chorus of disapproval aimed at michael prompted a humiliating public apology to sarah lacy, the editor of pandodaily, in which he disowned the idea entirely. michael posted an apology to lacy twitter account, saying: 'i would like to apologize to you directly. my comments were wrong and i deeply regret them. 'neither me [sic] nor my company would ever engage in such activities. again, i apologize.' the remarks will do little to improve uber fragile relationship with the media following the portrayal of its management team as insensitive and aggressive toward customer complaints. and, indeed, the apology did not stop lacy from writing a scathing opinion piece on pandodaily, in which she said the plan was 'like a five-year-old pretending to be frank underwood' - a reference to kevin spacey scheming politician character in netflix series house of cards. according to lacy, michael also called her cell phone and ask to speak in private, but hung up after she refused to have an off-the-record conversation. the dinner party in question was hosted by ian osborne, ex-adviser to british prime minister david cameron and consultant for uber . michael plan came up when he was asked about the firm negative press coverage. venue: during the dinner party at manhattan waverly inn (pictured), michael was reportedly asked about the firm depictions in the press and responded that uber should consider hiring researchers to snoop on writers . in response, the executive suggested that uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15 billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, according to buzzfeed. the eight-strong hit team would investigate 'your personal lives, your families' with a view to discrediting journalists behind unfavorable reports on the taxi service, he said. michael was especially focused on lacy, who also recently accused uber of exism and misogyny' on her silicon valley website, writing: 'the company simply doesn’t respect us or prioritize our safety.' he reportedly expressed anger over her claims that, responding that women are far more likely to suffer assault at the hands of normal taxi drivers than uber drivers. he said lacy should be held 'personally responsible' for any women who copy her and delete the taxi app, and are then sexually assaulted, it is reported . apology: michael, who used to work at klout and also sits on a board advising the department of defense, later took to twitter to apologize for his comments to lacy herself, saying: 'i would like to apologize to you directly' contradicting his remarks: he added: 'neither me nor my company would ever engage in such activities' and in reference to a specific claim about lacy personal life, he said uber dirt-diggers could work covertly to expose and discredit her to others, adding: 'nobody would know it was us.' after being confronted about his comments, michael, who has been at uber for more than a year and was previously described as a 'top deal guy' by founder travis kalanick, later apologized. in a statement to buzzfeed on monday evening, he said he believed he was speaking off the record and that his remarks did not reflect his or uber views. 'the remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what i feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company i am proud to work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company’s views or approach,' he said. 'they were wrong no matter the circumstance and i regret them.' at no point during the dinner did michael suggest the firm has already hired opposition researchers. an uber spokesman confirmed that the company does not carry out such research and has never considered doing it because it would be a 'clear violation of our privacy and data access policies'. the event at waverly inn on friday evening was attended by a number of high-profile figures, including actor ed norton and publisher arianna huffington. uber consultant: the dinner was hosted by ian osborne (pictured), ex-adviser to british pm david cameron . the event on friday evening was attended by actor ed norton (left) and publisher arianna huffington (right) response: on monday, ms lacy responded to buzzfeed article on her site (pictured), saying: 'companies shouldn’t be allowed to go to illegal lengths to defame and silence reporters'\""

        "Overview: BART is a transformer model developed by Facebook AI that combines bidirectional and auto-regressive elements. It is designed for tasks that involve sequence generation, such as text summarization, machine translation, and text generation. BART can be thought of as a generalization of both BERT (which is bidirectional) and GPT (which is auto-regressive).\n",
        "\n",
        "Architecture: BART is essentially an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder is similar to BERT and the decoder is similar to GPT. The encoder takes the input text, processes it bidirectionally, and then the decoder generates the output text auto-regressively (predicting each word one at a time).\n",
        "\n",
        "### DistilBART\n",
        "\n",
        "Overview: DistilBART is a distilled version of BART. Distillation is a process where a smaller model (the \"student\") is trained to mimic the behavior of a larger model (the \"teacher\"), resulting in a model that is faster and lighter while retaining much of the performance of the original model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Efficiency: The primary goal of DistilBART is to provide a more efficient alternative to BART. It is typically smaller, faster, and requires less computational resources, making it suitable for deployment in environments with limited resources, such as mobile devices or real-time applications."

              "\"many people might associate roses with romance novels, but in fact the smell of chocolate tempts readers to buy loved-up fiction. researchers at antwerp university in belgium found that while a chocolatey smell makes people hungry to buy romance novels, it does not necessarily tempt people to buy grittier genres such as crime or business books. the scientists, who permeated a bookshop with the perfume of chocolate, also found that the scent encouraged customers to browse through titles. the government funded study found that bookshop visitors were almost six times more likely to buy a romance novel if they smelt chocolate - and the same results applied to cookery books too . they studied the behaviour of 201 customers in a popular chain bookshop over ten days to find that customers were 3.5 times more likely to pick up romance novels when they smelt chocolate, the guardian reported. the government funded study also found that bookshop visitors were almost six times more likely to buy a romance novel - and the same results applied to cookery books too. belgium scientists found the smell of chocolate makes people buy romance books written by novelists such as dame barbara cartland (pictured) lieve douché, who led the study told the newspaper: 'when consumers smell chocolate, concepts . associated with chocolate, such as cooking, become more readily . accessible to the consumer mind and cause consumers to react . differently when encountering a cookbook than if they had not smelled . chocolate.' the researchers concluded romance, food and drink books were strongly linked with the smell of chocolate, but other categories of literature were not, such as comic and graphic novels, travel, art, gardening, crime, law and business books. however, perhaps sue to the scent encouraging customers to browse and deviate from their usual purchasing habits, sales of the 'incongruent' books also increased, with customers 1.2 times more likely to buy any of the books on offer in the chain bookshop. previous research has found that the smell of chocolate has a positive effect on a person mood, sparking feelings of pleasure or even arousal when shopping for goods. the belgium study said: 'the presence of a chocolate scent has a . positive influence on general approach behaviour and a negative impact . on goal-directed behaviour in the store.' retail experts already exploit customers' sense of smell to influence their attention span and buying behaviour. the new research has taken it a step further by marrying a specific scent with products - even if the books themselves do not have a distinctive smell.\""

The different ROUGE scores capture various aspects of the overlap between the generated text and the reference text. Here’s an overview of the most commonly used ROUGE metrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. ROUGE-N\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: ROUGE-N measures the overlap of n-grams (contiguous sequences of n items, typically words) between the generated summary and the reference summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Variants:\n",
        "\n",
        "- ROUGE-1: Measures the overlap of unigrams (single words). It evaluates the ability of the model to capture the content in individual words.\n",
        "- ROUGE-2: Measures the overlap of bigrams (two consecutive words). This captures the ability of the model to maintain the sequence of words.\n",
        "- ROUGE-3, ROUGE-4, etc.: Measure overlap of trigrams, four-grams, and so on. Higher n-grams capture more context but can be harder to match exactly.\n",
        "- Interpretation: Higher ROUGE-N scores indicate better preservation of the original content and structure in the generated text.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. ROUGE-L\n",
        "- Definition: ROUGE-L measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the generated and reference summaries. The LCS is a sequence that appears in both texts in the same order but not necessarily consecutively.\n",
        "- Why LCS?: Unlike n-gram overlap, LCS takes into account sentence-level word order and is less strict about consecutive matching, making it more adaptable to different writing styles.\n",
        "- ROUGE-LSum is a variant of the ROUGE-L metric, specifically designed for evaluating the quality of summarization tasks where multiple sentences are involved. It extends the original ROUGE-L by focusing on the sequence of sentences in addition to the sequence of words within those sentences."
